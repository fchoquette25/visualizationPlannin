My data set is going to be about the number of flights departing and landing from NYC airports (JFK, Laguardia and Newark) over the past 2 years in increments of months. If this data is too hefty, I am going to focus on one specific airport, most likely, JFK. I am going to display this data as a line chart, where there are going to be three lines, each representing one airport. The Y axis is going to be the amount of departures while the X axis is going to be the number of the month.
